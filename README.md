- Responsive Typography: Used rem, em, and clamp() to create scalable font sizes without media queries.
- Variable Fonts: Implemented flexible typography with fewer files using @font-face.
- Interactivity: Enhanced user experience with smooth hover and focus states using transitions.
- Design Depth: Added shadows and clean padding for a polished, professional look.
